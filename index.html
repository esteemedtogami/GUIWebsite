        <h2>Dog</h2>
        <p>
          This is my dog, Beckett! He is a yellow labrador retriever. We got
          him as a puppy in April of 2008. He's very smart, but it gets him
          into trouble sometimes. For example, when he's out in the yard by
          himself, he has a tendency to get his leash wrapped around chairs
          and other objects, and sits and barks until someone goes outside
          to untangle him. However, if he's tangled up and you offer him a
          biscuit, his ears perk up and he untangles himself and will come
          to the porch on his own, waiting for his reward. As annoying as
          this can sometimes be, it's pretty funny too.
